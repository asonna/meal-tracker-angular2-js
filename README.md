**User Stories**

Here are the three primary user stories for our Meal Tracker Application:

1- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all the foods I have logged.
2- As a user, I want to be able to click a food to edit its name, details or calories.
3- As a user, I want to be able to log in the food I've eaten on the same day using name, details and calories.(in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
4- As a user, I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories),
5- or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
