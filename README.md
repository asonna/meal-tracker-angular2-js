##Project Requirements / User stories

_Here are the three primary user stories for our Meal Tracker Application:_

1. As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all the foods I have logged.
2. As a user, I want to be able to click a food to edit its name, details or calories.
3. As a user, I want to be able to log in the food I've eaten on the same day using name, details and calories.(in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
4. As a user, I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories),
5. or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
